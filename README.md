# flag
The provided HTML and CSS code represents a simplified representation of the Indian flag. Here's a description of the code without any changes:
The HTML structure consists of a simple webpage with three <div> elements representing the three horizontal stripes of the Indian flag.
The CSS file flag1.css is linked to the HTML file, providing styles for each of the three <div> elements:
.first: Represents the top saffron stripe of the Indian flag. It has an orange background color and a height of 200px and a width of 800px.
.second: Represents the middle white stripe of the flag.
It has a white background color and includes an image of the Ashoka Chakra (Ashoka_Chakra.svg.png) as its background. 
The background image is centered (background-position: center) and doesn't repeat (background-repeat: no-repeat). It also has a height and width of 200px by 200px.
.third: Represents the bottom green stripe of the flag. It has a green background color and a height of 200px and a width of 800px.
This code provides a basic visual representation of the Indian flag with three horizontal stripes, where the middle stripe contains 
the Ashoka Chakra as an image background.
